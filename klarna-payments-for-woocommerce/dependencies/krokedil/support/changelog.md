## [Unreleased]

------------------
## [1.0.1] - 2025-06-10

### Fixed

* The JSON encoded report in the system report view was decoded twice: once when retrieved, and once when displayed which caused a fatal error. This has been corrected to ensure the report is only decoded once, only when it is about to be displayed.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-05-28

### Added

* Initial release of the package.
